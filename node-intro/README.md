Node.js is an open source server enviroment, which allows us to run Javascript on the server.

What is Node.js?
 * JavaScript Runtime:
   * Traditionally, JavaScript was primarily used for front-end web development, running inside web browsers. Node.js changed that by enabling JavaScript to be used for server-side programming.
   * It's built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which is incredibly fast.
 * Open-source and Cross-platform:
   * Node.js is freely available and can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
 * Server-side Applications:
   * This means you can use JavaScript to build back-end services, web servers, and other applications that run on a server.
 * Event-Driven, Non-Blocking I/O:
   * This is a crucial aspect of Node.js. Instead of waiting for one task to finish before starting another (blocking), Node.js uses an event loop to handle multiple tasks concurrently (non-blocking).
   * When a task involves input/output operations (like reading a file or making a network request), Node.js offloads that task and continues processing other requests. Once the I/O operation is complete, an event is triggered, and the corresponding callback function is executed.
 * Single-Threaded:
   * Node.js runs on a single thread, but its event-driven, non-blocking architecture allows it to handle many concurrent connections efficiently.
 
In simpler terms:
Imagine a restaurant where one waiter takes orders from multiple tables. Instead of waiting for each order to be cooked before taking the next one, the waiter takes all the orders and then hands them off to the kitchen. While the food is being prepared, the waiter can take more orders. This is similar to how Node.js handles requests.
- Benefits of Node.js
1.Its open source.
2.Reusability of code.
3.To improve speed and simplicity of implementation.
